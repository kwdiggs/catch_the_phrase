<h3>Overview</h3>
Catch the Phrase is a hot potato word game for two teams. When the game begins, a timer will start and the app will display one clue at a time. The player holding the app device must
describe the clue until their teammates successfully guess it. Then, the device will be passed to a player on the opposite team and this process will repeat with a new clue. To advance
to the next clue, the screen may be tapped or swiped. When the timer runs out, the \"timeup\" sound will play, and the team not holding the device will be awarded a point. The first team
to score 7 points wins.
